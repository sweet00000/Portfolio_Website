              <p> 
                This is a very basic implimentation of a modular neural network in Python that only uses the Numpy library.
                The program is best suited for solving classification problems.
                The weights and biases of each node in the network are "trained" using data and a given value between 0 and 1.
                A loss function is used to optimize the network's prediction of this value for new data entries.
                This program was applied to tomato data from the project above and achieved 95% similar results.

              <h3> Electric Bicycle - Discovery project</h3>

              <p>
                This is the powertrain for an electric bicycle that I have been building for personal transportation.
                The power source is a 48 volt 18 amp lithium ion battery pack. 
                This is controlled by a 48 volt dc voltage controller and sent to a brushed dc motor.
                While planning for this project I wrote a script that will calculate the theoretical maximum speed the bike will be able to achieve with given gear ratios.
                The calculator does not account for friction, drag, or incline so the resulting maximum calculated speed is much greater than will actually be achieved.
                I am currently designing a bracket to hold the battery and motor to the frame of the bicycle.
                The bracket will be made of metal welded together and then, if possible, bolted onto the frame of the bike.

                This program converts an image into the HSV color space and creates a new image for each hue value within a specified range.
